            Mariah Peck is 21 years old and was born and raised in the state of Pennsylvania. 
            As a young girl, she enjoyed playing on her school’s basketball team, but she soon 
            had to quit her hobby as she was diagnosed with Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. 
            This means her heart has an extra electrical pathway, causing rapid heartbeats that make her struggle day-to-day. 
            At the age of 13, Mariah underwent cardiac ablation, which was a surgery performed on her heart to help her symptoms. 
            Though she did soon after, at 14 years old, get the best present of her life. 
            Her dog, Delilah, is a German Shepherd, the exact kind of dog breed she has wanted ever since she was little. 
            Even though she couldn’t return to playing sports, she found lots of new hobbies to occupy her time. 
            Mariah found that she liked making candles. Some of her candles she combines with another passion of hers, crystals. 
            She loves all things witchy and would add shards of crystals on top of her candles. Speaking of her witchy activities, she found a love for gardening. 
            Yes, she has vegetables and flowers in her garden, but her main focus is growing all different kinds of pumpkins. 
            Her goal is to harvest her pumpkins to bake lots of pumpkin-flavored sweets. She wants to learn to bake all kinds of things.
             Mariah also got a telescope, as she loves looking at the moon as well as all the constellations. 
             Her favorite is Canis Major, which translates to “Greater Dog," as she loves dogs so much. 
             Additionally, she makes different kinds of art, whether it be drawings, paintings, or her crochet works. 
             Overall, despite the challenges Mariah faces, she doesn’t let that stop her from finding new passions. 
             Her goal is to become an author, as she has always had a deep interest in writing and would find herself making up stories all the time. 
             Her favorite story is that of Harry Potter by J.K. Rowling. Mariah will soon be starting school to pursue her dream of becoming a writer.
